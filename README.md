This is the author's collection of scripts, tools, and supporting code to simplify
the HGS work flow, create input files, parse/modify output files, and perform other
analyses. The workflow is mainly centred on HGS' capability as a discrete fracture-
matrix, sub-surface domain, flow and contaminant transport simulator; other aspects
of HGS' functionality are not specifically considered or tested for these tools.
