A collection of tools that operate adjacent to Aquanty Inc.'s HydroGeoSphere.

This is the author's collection of scripts, tools, and supporting code to simplify
the HGS work flow, create input files, parse/modify output files, and perform other
analyses. The workflow is mainly centred on HGS' capability as a discrete fracture-
matrix, sub-surface domain, flow and contaminant transport simulator; other aspects
of HGS' functionality are not specifically considered or tested for these tools.
